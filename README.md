# Welcome 
This is an instant messaging app built with React. This project is for demo purposes to showcase my skills.
It is not made for production purposes.

# Technology Used
React, Web Sockets, Redux, Redux-Saga, and Node.js.

# How to Use
1) Clone the repository to your local machine.
2) At the root folder, add all dependencies with yarn or npm.
3) At the root folder, ttart the react server by entering "yarn start" or "npm start."
4) At the root folder, run the backend Node server by running this command: sudo chmod 0777 ./server/app.js
5) CD into the "server" folder.
6) In the server folder, enter "node app.js" to run the server.

Voila! You should now be able to demo the chat app that I have built. The names generated will be randomly assigned.
You can test the application by running multiple pages. The app will treat each page like a seperate user.

Enjoy! :)
